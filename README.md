Project: Famous people - Make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, then make more tables about things they do and join those to create readable lists.


In this exercise I created one table populated with star wars characters, the character ID, first name and last name. In the second table I populated with some bio info about them. This included the bio ID, character ID foreign key, their job and their home. I filled these tables with 15 random Star Wars characters and their info.

I then carried out some Select queries joining the tables together. The first matched the character's first and last name with their job. The second highlighted their first and last name and where they are form and I further filtered this with a where clause to highlight those who were a Jedi Master. The final query I carried out highlighted all those whose home is the Millenium Falcon and also who has the job role of Smuggler.
